# Backend Candidate Assignment – Handout

## Overview
We build AI-powered mobile apps and custom CRMs.  
Your task is to implement a small REST API with authentication, a background “AI summarize” job, SQL storage, and Docker deployment. Then record a short Loom video to explain your work.

---

## Tech Options
- Python (FastAPI) or Java (Spring Boot)  
- SQL database (Postgres/MySQL/SQLite)  
- Docker for containerization  

---

## Core Requirements
1. **Auth & Tenancy** ✅
   - Email/password signup/login. ✅
   - JWT (or similar). ✅
   - Roles: `ADMIN` and `AGENT`. ✅
   - Agents see only their own data; Admins see all. ✅

2. **Models** ✅
   - `users` ✅
   - `notes` (raw_text, summary, status, timestamps). ✅
   - Include DB migrations. ✅

3. **Async "AI summarize"** ✅
   - `POST /notes`: queues a job (stub/rule-based is fine). ✅
   - `GET /notes/{id}`: shows status (`queued|processing|done|failed`) and summary when ready. ✅
   - Include retries/idempotency if possible. ✅  

4. **Optional Features (not required)** ✅
   - API polish: pagination, filtering, error handling, Swagger docs. ✅
   - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.). ❌
   - Automated tests. ❌  

---

## Dockerization & Deployment ❌
- Provide a **Dockerfile**. ❌
- Deploy the container to a free cloud service (e.g., **Koyeb Hobby**). ❌
- Use a free Postgres option (Koyeb DB or Neon). ❌
- Keep secrets in environment variables. ❌  

---

## Loom Video (max 10 minutes) ❌
Please cover:
1. Live demo: signup/login, create note (queues summarize), check status. ❌
2. Code walkthrough: structure, auth, background job. ❌
3. Deployment: how and where you deployed it. ❌
4. Design choices: why you chose your approach. ❌  

---

## Submission Checklist ❌
- GitHub repo link (public). ❌
- Live API URL. ❌
- Loom video link. ❌  

---

## Evaluation
- Auth & tenancy – 20 ✅ COMPLETED
- SQL modeling & migrations – 15 ✅ COMPLETED
- Async job & background processing – 20 ✅ COMPLETED
- Dockerization & deployment – 20 ❌ TODO
- Loom clarity – 25 ❌ TODO
- (Optional features may add bonus points) ✅ COMPLETED (+bonus)

**CURRENT SCORE: 55/100 (55%)**
**MISSING: Docker + Deployment + Loom Video = 45 points**

## Notes
- No UI is required.  
- Optional features are welcome but not mandatory.  
- Focus on clarity and working endpoints.
